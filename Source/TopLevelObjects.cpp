// A LavishScript Top-Level Object is similar to a global C++ object.  The main difference is that
// a TLO can give ANY data type it wants; it is not limited to a single type.  You may wish to give
// a different type depending on the index (parameters, dimensions, etc) for example.  Usually, though,
// you simply give one specific type.
